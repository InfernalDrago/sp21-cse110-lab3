                <p>
                    On <b class="date">Friday April 9th</b>, I met up with my CSE110 group for an Intro Meeting at <span class="time">5:00 pm</span>.
                     We all introduced ourselves, decided our team name and logo, and played skribbl.io for about an hour. 
                     At about <span class="time">6:00 pm</span>, I met up with the team responsible for organizing this years DataHacks event. We discussed 
                     how the event would start off and any last minute news. At <span class="time">10:30 pm</span>, my partner for the event and I presented 
                     our dataset track to the participants and ended our night there.

                    On <b class="date">Saturday April 10th</b>, I had signed up for two 2 hour sessions when I would have to stay on a voice channel
                 for DataHacks in case any participants had questions concerning the datasets. There weren't many participants in those 4 hours 
                 so I passed the time playing video games while waiting for the next person to join the voice channel. With the few participants I 
                 interacted with, some of them had questions I didn't understand so I was <em>really</em> stressed with those until another 
                 mentor joined in. In between the two sessions I hosted a workshop on writing the final reports that would be turned in to the judges. I presented twice in my time slot because 
                 some people arrived late to the session. After my last mentor session ended at <span class="time">9:00 pm</span>, I watched 28 Days Later with my family and 
                 went to bed.

                <p>
                    On <b class="date">Sunday April 11th</b>, my family and I went out to eat brunch at a restaurant called <i class="restaurant">Cafe Sevilla</i>. We ordered a <strong>9 course</strong> appetizer that included:
                    <br> 
                    <ul class="container">
                        <li class="item-a">Eggs Benedict</li>
                        <li class="item-b">Potato Tart</li>
                        <li class="item-c">Ceviche</li>
                        <li class="item-d">Filled Dates</li>
                        <li class="item-e">Cheese Empanada</li>
                        <li class="item-f">Meatballs</li>
                        <li class="item-g">Salmon</li>
                        <li class="item-h">Short Ribs</li>
                        <li class="item-i">Lemon Tart</li>
                    </ul>
                    After the appetizers we ordered two <strong>3 course</strong> meals that included:
                    <br>
                    <ol class="flex-container">
                        <ol>
                        <li class="flex-item"> Bread with Tomato Paste and Serrano Ham</li>
                        <li class="flex-item"> Pork Belly Paella</li>
                        <li class="flex-item"> Churros with Chocolate</li>
                        </ol>
                    </ol>
                    It was all really good and we left satisfied.
